- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julien Geula
- I have been in a coding class but do not have much experience so this might take some getting used to and help.
- I want to be a strong coder, understand computer science, and learn how to work with coding language.
- I ate a very good chicken veal in spain and i really enjoyed it.
