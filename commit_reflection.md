Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
YES, I can because I can see on the commits what I am doing and the next steps.
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
Every time I made a commit I wrote down what I had done which makes it easy to track
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
When I get a job keeping my stuff clear and concise will help me and my work partners
