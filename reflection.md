-What was challenging for you during this process?
I think what was challenging was still just getting into the grove of working with the system and with the new lines of code you taught us in class.
-What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
I think the lines of code you taught us with mousex and mouse y which is where the mose moves is one of the cooridnates of the shape.
-What are you proud of?
I am proud of working with the system and making a cool shape which I could also carry on these skills with me in my life.
